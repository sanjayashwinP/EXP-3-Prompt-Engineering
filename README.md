## Output
Evaluation of 2024 Prompting Tools Across Diverse AI Platforms
1. Introduction
Prompting tools in 2024 have matured into sophisticated assistants, providing not just answers but context-aware, multi-turn interactions. This evaluation compares ChatGPT (GPT-4o), Claude 3.5, Google Gemini, Cohere Command R+, and Meta Llama 3.1 across summarization, technical Q&A, and creative writing.
2. Background and Evolution of Prompting Tools
The evolution of prompting tools has been rapid, moving from short-context, text-only systems in 2022 to multimodal, long-context, enterprise-ready assistants in 2024. Key developments include expanded context windows, custom instructions, and tighter integration with productivity suites.
3. Objectives
The study aims to: 
- Compare performance in summarization, technical Q&A, and creative writing.
- Evaluate user experience and ease of prompting.
- Highlight strengths, weaknesses, and best-fit use cases.
4.Methodology
Use Cases:
Summarization of a long policy document.
Technical explanation with code (Dijkstra’s algorithm).
Creative writing: “Write a 300-word futuristic story about AI ethics in healthcare.”
Setup: Identical prompts across platforms, with temperature set low (≈0.2) for determinism.
Scoring: 3 reviewers independently rated on factuality, clarity, creativity, and usability.

5. Prompt Design
Summarization Prompt: Summarize into 5 concise bullets with citations.
Technical Q&A Prompt: Explain Dijkstra’s algorithm with steps, code, and example.
Creative Writing Prompt: Write a 300-word sci-fi story about AI ethics in healthcare.
6. Evaluation Rubric
The rubric focused on Accuracy, Faithfulness, Clarity, Creativity, Code Quality, and User Experience. Scores were assigned from 1 to 5.
7. Comparative Results
Results showed Claude 3.5 leading in depth and caution, GPT-4o balancing speed and reliability, Gemini excelling in Google integration, Cohere R+ focusing on enterprise RAG, and Llama 3.1 offering strong open-source potential.
